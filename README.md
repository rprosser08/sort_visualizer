# Sorting Visualizer
This project shows how different sorting algorithms look, including quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort. 

## Build Status
It is currently being developed, with quick sort, merge sort, heap sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort being completed. Plan on cleaning up the UI to make it look better overall. 

## Tech / Framework
This project is built mainly with JavaScript and React, with a little bit of HTML, and CSS for styling.

## How to run
You will need npm intalled, which can be done with running "npm install" in your terminal. Then you can simply run "npm start" in your terminal. 

Once it is up and running, you can generate a new array to sort with the "Create New Array" button or see a sorting algorithm by clicking one of the sorting algorthms.
